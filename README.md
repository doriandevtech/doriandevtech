  Hi there, I’m Dorian 👋
</h1>

<h2 align="center"> Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻</h2> 

<h3 align="left">What do I do in the coding world ?</h3>

- 👀 I’m learning **Swift** using Apple Developer Documentation and ressources across the internet 🌐.
- 🏆 My goal is to build and submit my **1st** **app** on the App Store📱 by mid-year 📆 (around june or july).
- 🧠 My learning process is by getting **informations** and trying to transform them into **knowledge**, by coding by myself 👨🏻‍🔧
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I just build my first apps in Swift called **AsianFoodApp**, **MySneakers** and **GuardiansOfTheGalaxy**, they are #OpenSource 🔓 so don't hesitate to check them out 👇 and give me feedbacks ⏮️
